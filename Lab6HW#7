t.test(age_diff ~ educ_numeric, data = subset_data)

The subgroup was people aged between 25-55 and who worked at least 35 hours a week.
Based on the regression model , here are the results :
  
  The intercept has a value of 2e-16, which means it is far apart from zero
  For the educ_numeric variable , the p-value is also 2e-16 , the coefficient is statistically significant.
  For the h_educ_numeric variable, the p-value is 0.00134 which suggests that the education level of the head of the household has a different effect on age difference than that of the spouse.
  For poly(AGE, 2)1 and poly(h_age, 2)1, the p - value is 2e-16, these results tell us that the age of the spouse has a strong relationship with the age difference.
  For poly(Age, 2)2, the p-value was 0.04632, which means that there is a strong relation between age difference and the age of the spouse.
  For poly(h_age, 2)2, the p - value was 0.84858, which shows little significance and relation between the two.

Artcles:
The two academic articles that I focused on were “The Effect of the Three-Point Line on Basketball Scoring and Strategy” by R.D. Hill and J.J. Pritchard and “Scoring, Efficiency, and Rule Changes in the NBA: The Evolution of Basketball” by C.H. Stone and A.S. Evans. These articles help me do further research on how the NBA’s scoring average has varied throughout the years.
	For “The Effect of the Three-Point Line on Basketball Scoring and Strategy” , it analyzes the implementation of the 3 point line and how that impacted scoring trends afterwards. It also includes how teams and players have spaced out and how that impacted the defensive side as well. The changes in strategies that coaches have integrated were also highlighted.
	For “Scoring, Efficiency, and Rule Changes in the NBA: The Evolution of Basketball” , it analyzes the impact of rule changes on scoring. Rule changes include shot clock violations, hand checking and defensive rule variation. They mention the scoring efficiency as well and how it had long term and short term effects when those rules were adjusted.
	Econometrics techniques that can be used when utilizing these articles for my project would be regressions and models. They would visualize the trends and relationships between rule changes/new implementations and scoring over the decades.
